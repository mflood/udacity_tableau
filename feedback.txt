A few things for Traffic Accidents by Month: 
    1. Since you are using position to show the count of accidents, using circle size for count is redundant. 
    2. Using different colors for each neighborhood is also redundant since each neighborhood gets its own column.
    You might consider putting the neighborhoods on the X-Axis so you can see how all the neighborhoods change with respect to eachother

Having different colors for each neighborhood on the map is redundant, since we can tell which neighborhood it is by the position on the map.

Put each sheet in a Dashboard, and then put the dashboards into the story, that way you can add text elements to the layout.
